\title{Smaller Circuits for Summation and Multiplication}


\begin{abstract}
	The Full Adder and Half Adder are used frequently when synthesizing Boolean circuits.
	For example, one can compute the binary representation of~the sum of~$n$~inputs bits
	using at~most~$n$ Full and Half Adders. Also, a~circuit computing the sum of~two $n$-bit
	numbers can be~composed out of~one Half Adder and $(n-1)$ Full Adders. Finally, 
	to~compute the product of~two $n$-bit numbers, one first computes $n^2$ partial products
	and then adds them using about $n^2$ Full and Half Adders. Two natural strategies for 
	adding the partial products were presented by~Wallace and Dadda.
	
	In~this paper, we~study the size of~circuits composed out of~Full and Half Adders, 
	over the full binary basis. Interestingly, many such circuits are suboptimal:
	for example, already the sum of~five input bits can be~computed more efficiently
	than by~using two Full Adders and a~single Half Adder. We~show that, in~many interesting
	regimes, circuits composed out of~Full and Half Adders, can be~made about 10\% smaller.
	This applies to~Wallace and Dadda multipliers.
	We~provide open source implementation of~generators producing efficient
	circuits for summation and multiplication.

\section{Overview}
The Full Adder and Half Adder 
(abbreviated~as FA and HA and also known~as 3:2 and 2:2 compressors, respectively)
are used frequently when synthesizing Boolean circuits.
